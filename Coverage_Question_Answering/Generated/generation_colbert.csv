Can you confirm that if an employee is working from home and computer gets hacked compromising United States Artists info, is there coverage for cyber?

 

Does it matter if they are using their own personal computer vs a business owned computer?

Does it matter if they are using their own personal computer vs a business owned computer?","Based on the policy documents, there may be coverage for a cyber event if an employee's computer gets hacked and compromises United States Artists' information. The policy defines ""Computer Systems"" to include various devices and software used to collect, store, and process data on behalf of the insured, whether owned or leased by the insured.\\n\\nHowever, if the compromised device is an employee's personal computer, the situation becomes more complex. The policy states that ""Security failure does not mean and will not include any failure of computers, related peripheral components, or mobile devices that are owned or leased by an employee to the extent that such failure does not affect the business operations of the named insured or a subsidiary."" Therefore, whether the employee's personal computer is covered may depend on whether the failure directly impacts the business operations of United States Artists.\\n\\nFor a business-owned computer, the policy outlines that computer replacement costs are covered if the loss of integrity in the firmware of any computer systems due to a security failure is discovered during the policy period.\\n\\nIn summary, the type of device (personal vs. business-owned) might influence the coverage, particularly in terms of whether the security failure impacts business operations.","Based on the policy documents, coverage for a cyber incident involving an employee working from home would depend on the definition of ""computer systems"" and the specifics of the policy coverage.

The term ""computer systems"" includes both business-owned and hosted computer systems, which are defined as:
1. Computers and related peripheral components, including Internet of Things (IoT) devices;
2. Systems and applications software including SCADA and Industrial Control Systems;
3. Terminal devices;
4. Related communications networks;
5. Mobile devices (handheld and other wireless computing devices); and
6. Storage and back-up devices.

These systems can be operated by the insured on their own behalf or by a third-party vendor providing hosted computer services under a written contract.

However, the policy does not explicitly mention personal computers owned by employees. Therefore, if the employee is using their own personal computer, it may not be covered unless it falls under the definition of ""computer systems"" as outlined in the policy.

If the compromised computer is a business-owned computer or a hosted computer system as defined, then there would likely be coverage for the cyber incident. If it is a personal computer, coverage may not be guaranteed unless it is explicitly included in the policy's definition of covered computer systems.","Hi Tony,

Personal devices are covered when used for business purposes.

The definition of computer systems includes computers, mobile devices, etc operated by ""you"" on your own behalf. ""You"" includes employees ""but only while acting on behalf of the named insured or subsidiary and in the scope of the business operations of the named insured or subsidiary.""

Bryan",,Yes,Yes,"### Category:
Can be answered with documents

### Justification:
The email query from Tony Spirovski specifically asks whether there is coverage for a cyber incident involving an employee working from home, where the employee's computer gets hacked, potentially compromising sensitive information. Furthermore, the query requests clarification on whether the type of computer (personal vs. business-owned) affects the coverage. These questions directly relate to the specifics of what is covered under a cyber insurance policy and under what circumstances, which are typically detailed in the policy documents.

### Potential Document:
The appropriate document to answer this query would be the cyber insurance policy document, specifically ""Policy C-4LQT-064011-CYBER-2023"" mentioned in the original message. This document likely contains definitions, inclusions, exclusions, and conditions that apply to cyber insurance coverage, which can provide the necessary information to address the query about coverage specifics related to working from home and the type of computer used.",normal,closed,renewals@coalitioninc.com,1268841149770,1268841149770,4501406464027,6157100432795.0,10429086656667,,False,True,4565964437403,1260802700910,,,,,Apogee Insurance Group,4000000.0,4000000.0,<=$100MM,True,,"[

This implies that any claims related to the infringement of software copyrights are excluded from coverage.\\n\\n2. **Waiver of Subrogation**: The policy clearly states that it does not allow for a waiver of subrogation.

2. **The policy does not allow for waiver of subrogation and instead requires us to do everything necessary to preserve subrogation rights**: This statement is not entirely accurate. The policy documents indicate that there are provisions for waiving subrogation rights under certain conditions. For instance, the waiver of subrogation can be applied if it is waived by the insured under a written contract with the person or organization prior to the incident or event giving rise to the claim or loss (as seen in multiple excerpts, such as the one with Form Number SP 15 456 01 18).

Justification: The questions posed in the email adhere to the formats that can typically be addressed using the policy documents:
1. The question about whether copyright infringement includes coverage for software infringement can be classified as asking about the specifics of a coverage (i.e., ""Does Y coverage cover Z use case?"").
2. The inquiry about the policy's stance on waiver of subrogation is also asking for clarification about specific policy terms (i.e., ""Does X policy include Y coverage(s)?"").
3. The question regarding the insurance company's qualifications to do business in a specific state and its ratings can be answered by referring to company documentation or public records that verify business qualifications and ratings.

Potential Document:
1. For the copyright infringement and subrogation waiver inquiries, the relevant cyber insurance policy document would be the primary source to confirm the coverage specifics and policy terms.

This customer has a couple questions about the proposal we provided. Please advise if you have documentation we may provide regarding the pre-claim assistance and also address the question regarding recourse against Trustees and waiver if possible. Thank you.

 

The limits look good, except I have a question about:

 

Pre-Claim Assistance   $820         Pre-claim assistance is a benefit included as part of the premium. See Section V, CLAIMS PROCESS, PRECLAIM ASSISTANCE of the Policy for more details.

 

Not sure what that is about.  I did not see a policy attached so could not read about it.  Additionally, is there any right of recourse against the Trustees?  If so, would like to have a waiver of that provision.

I did not see a policy attached so could not read about it.  Additionally, is there any right of recourse against the Trustees?  If so, would like to have a waiver of that provision.","Based on the policy documents provided, there is no explicit mention of a ""right of recourse against the Trustees."" However, the policy does include provisions related to subrogation and waiver of subrogation rights. Specifically, it states: \\n\\n""This obligation does not apply to the extent that the right to subrogate is waived by you under a written contract with that person or organization, prior to the incident or event giving rise to the claim or loss.""\\n\\nThis may imply that if you have a written contract that waives the right to subrogation with respect to the Trustees, it should be honored, and the policy should not pursue recourse against them. For a more precise determination, consulting the full policy document or seeking legal advice would be advisable.","Based on the policy documents provided, there is no specific mention of a right of recourse against the Trustees. The documents primarily discuss the obligations related to subrogation rights and waivers of subrogation under certain conditions. 

For instance, the ""Waiver of Subrogation Endorsement"" states that the obligation to preserve subrogation rights does not apply to persons or organizations listed in the attached schedule, provided that the right to subrogate is waived under a written contract prior to the incident or event giving rise to the claim or loss.

If you are looking for a waiver of any right of recourse against the Trustees, you may need to consult the specific policy or endorsement that addresses this issue directly, or you may need to request an amendment to the policy to include such a waiver.","
Please see the attached Specimen Policy. The Pre-Claim Assistance piece is found at the top of page 21 of the Specimen PDF. We advise review with the insured and their legal counsel to determine fit within their request. Let us know if anything else is needed.

",,Wrong,Yes,"**Category:** Can be answered with documents

**Justification:** 
The email presents specific questions related to the insurance policy, particularly about ""Pre-Claim Assistance"" and the rights of recourse against Trustees. These questions align with the types of inquiries that can be addressed using company documents:

1. **Pre-Claim Assistance:** The email queries what ""Pre-Claim Assistance"" entails since it is mentioned as part of the premium. This fits the query type that seeks definition or explanation of a coverage aspect mentioned in the policy documents.

2. **Right of Recourse Against Trustees:** The email inquires whether there is any right of recourse against the Trustees and the possibility of waiving that provision. This too can be classified under scenario-based questions regarding the extent of coverage or specific clauses within the policy.

Since both queries can potentially be answered by referring to specific sections of the policy document where these terms and conditions are detailed, they fit into the category of being answerable through documents.
